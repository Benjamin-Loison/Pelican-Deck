# Pelican-Deck
This is my first ever Cyberdeck build. My goal was a sleek, self-contained setup that could handle BadUSB scripts and more. The Pi is powered by a USB battery pack, with a smaller one for the screen, and everythingâ€™s designed to be portable, including water-resistant ports (USB, Ethernet, HDMI, and USB-C).
